ChronosBench v1.0

A CLI that hammers your CPU and (if you’re on a newer Mac) the Metal GPU too.
Live bars in the terminal show how busy the chips are while it crunches matrices, FFTs, and a bunch of fake particles.

When it’s done you get a tiny JSON report in reports/—mostly so you can prove to your future self that this laptop used to be fast.

Run:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py

Then grab a coffee.
